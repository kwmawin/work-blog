This post is used as my notebook for fun readings I recently found on LinkedIn, Medium, and many other places. I will continue to update and add more links!

**Dec 03, 2018:** [An exclusive look inside Googleâ€™s in-house incubator Area 120](https://www.fastcompany.com/90262791/an-exclusive-look-inside-googles-in-house-incubator-area-120). Google had been having well-known cultural code of encouraging employees to "spend 20% of time a week to work on new things not related to their daily job." However as the company expanding and employees are devoting 100% of time on their routine engineering works, the idea of 20% time has become "120% time."
This is why Google created "Area 120," an Google internal incubator where employees can leave their original job to start fully engaged in new projects they come up with, after they pitch to Area 120 staff and get green-light. I especially love this idea, because I have heard about how difficult and frustrating the process is for a general startup team to search for seed money. With Area 120, the person you pitch to is your fellow Googlers and it is easier for them to understand your idea. You can even hire other smart Google engineers to work together in the incubator. And finally, it is just easy to get bored working on day-to-day job. Why not brainstorm with friends in the same company for new idea, and spend 100% to achieve it? (although it's named Area 120, you don't really need to spend 120% of time a week:) )


**Nov 30, 2018:** [An Inside Look at Reddit's Video Infrastructure](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/inside-look-reddits-video-infrastructure-chris-slowe/) by Chris Slowe, CTO of Reddit. It is interesting to see the idea of temporary and permanent buckets, and how Reddit uses them to handle large amount of video uploads and prevent from failed upload to mess up their database. Once videos moved to permanent buckets, transcoding task will then started by AWS Lambda. 


**Oct 24, 2018:** [Curiosity and Procrastination](https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/10/curiosity-and-procrastination-in.html) by Google AI. This article briefly introduced Google AI's work on curiosity-driven exploration, where while continuing on predicting the future, the agent tends to be "curious" and rewards "surprise," which means when the agent sees something different from their prediction, it tends to go further and explore it. This is very helpful when working on task such as escaping from a maze. One side-effect is "procrastination," where the agent at the same time tends to be attracted by randomly changing object. I really like the example of a TV randomly switching channels. Even if the there is only small number of channels, the randomness will mostly cause surprise to the agent and attract it away from exploring the other parts of world. This effect can pretty much be seen in real world, on each of us human!
